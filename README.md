# MLAgent_Assembler_Training

This repository contains scripts and resources for training a reinforcement learning model using the ML-Agents package inside Unity.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to train an agent to perform a specific task using imitation learning. The agent is first trained with transfer-learning methods and later trained indepednantly to create unique solving skills.. After that, I fine-tune the agent using reinforcement learning techniques.

## Training Expectations

The agent was trained for 7 days continuously, with regular checkpoints saved to ensure progress was not lost.
